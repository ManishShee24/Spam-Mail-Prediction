# Spam-Mail-Prediction

In this article, we will explore and understand the process of classifying emails as spam or not spam. This is called Spam Detection, and it is a binary classification problem.

The reason to do this is simple: by detecting unsolicited and unwanted emails, we can prevent spam messages from creeping into the userâ€™s inbox, thereby improving user experience.
